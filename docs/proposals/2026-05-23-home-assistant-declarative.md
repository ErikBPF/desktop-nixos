# Home Assistant as a First-Class Citizen

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Status:** Proposal
**Owner:** erik
**Target hosts:** `discovery` (primary), optional `orion` fallback

---

## 1. Goal

Promote the Home Assistant deployment from an opaque HAOS VM to a fully version-controlled, declarative subsystem that lives alongside the existing NixOS + servarr (compose) configuration.

Concretely:

- **Config-as-code** — every YAML file, blueprint, dashboard, and automation under a Git repo on GitHub.
- **Declarative integrations/plugins** — additions to HA happen via a PR to a Nix file or a tracked YAML file, not by clicking in the UI.
- **Declarative automations** — Nix or Git is the source of truth; UI edits are either banned or auto-committed.
- **CI** — `ha core check_config` runs on every PR before it can reach the live instance.
- **Reproducibility** — nuking the VM/container and rebuilding yields the same instance.

---

## 2. Current State (baseline)

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| HAOS VM definition | `modules/hosts/discovery/haos.nix` + `haos-domain.xml` |
| Disk image | `/home/erik/vault/vms/haos_ova-17.1.qcow2` (libvirt, qcow2, opaque) |
| Network | bridge `br0` → DHCP-reserved `192.168.10.115` |
| USB passthrough | Silicon Labs CP210x (Zigbee/Z-Wave) |
| Supervisor / Add-ons | Provided by HAOS (Mosquitto, ESPHome, Studio Code Server, etc.) |
| Backups | None automated — qcow2 sits on `vault/` |
| Git | **None** — `/config` inside HAOS is not under version control |
| servarr pattern (reference) | `homelab.compose.stacks` in `modules/hosts/{orion,discovery}/compose.nix` with bind-mounted dirs under `/home/erik/servarr/machines/<host>/` |

**Gap:** the HAOS VM is the *only* part of the homelab that isn't reproducible from `git clone && nixos-rebuild`. Every other service (servarr stacks, hermes agent, alloy, kepler-nfs) is declared in Nix and/or compose YAML tracked in this repo.

---

## 3. Options

Three paths, in increasing order of "Nix-native" purity and decreasing order of HAOS-feature parity.

### Option A — Keep HAOS VM, add Git-as-source-of-truth on `/config`

Lowest risk. HAOS keeps Supervisor + Add-ons. We treat `/config` inside HAOS as a working tree of a GitHub repo (`erik/home-assistant-config`, private).

- Initialise `git` inside HAOS `/config` via Studio Code Server terminal.
- Restructure config: split `configuration.yaml` into folders (`automations/`, `scripts/`, `packages/`, `blueprints/`, `dashboards/`), all `!include`-d from the root file.
- `secrets.yaml`, `.storage/`, DB files added to `.gitignore`.
- SSH deploy key with **write** access (push) configured inside the VM.
- Daily HA-side automation runs `backup2git.sh` at 02:00, committing UI-driven changes — this preserves the "click in UI" workflow while still producing a git history.
- GitHub Actions workflow runs `ha core check_config` on every push to `main`.
- Optional: a separate "puller" script that runs `git pull --ff-only` on `/config` after the GHA job passes and emits a Reload event.

**Pros:** No service downtime, no add-on loss, immediate version control + rollback, smallest change footprint.
**Cons:** HAOS itself remains opaque (still a qcow2 blob). Plugins (HACS / custom integrations) are still installed via UI clicks unless we also vendor them into the repo under `custom_components/`.

### Option B — Replace HAOS with NixOS `services.home-assistant` module on `discovery`

Most Nix-idiomatic. HA Core runs as a systemd unit on `discovery`, all config is generated from Nix attribute sets.

- Add `modules/services/home-assistant.nix` mirroring the servarr pattern (toggleable via `homelab.homeAssistant.enable`).
- Use `services.home-assistant.config = { ... }` for fully declarative YAML; mix with `"automation ui" = "!include automations.yaml"` to keep UI-authoring as an escape hatch.
- `services.home-assistant.extraComponents = [ "zha" "esphome" "met" ... ]` resolves Python deps automatically.
- `services.home-assistant.customComponents = [ pkgs.home-assistant-custom-components.<x> ... ]` for HACS-equivalents that already exist in nixpkgs (`pkgs/servers/home-assistant/custom-components/`).
- `services.home-assistant.customLovelaceModules = [ pkgs.home-assistant-custom-lovelace-modules.<x> ]` for frontend cards.
- Zigbee stick → ZHA component + udev rule pinning the CP210x to a stable `/dev/serial/by-id/...`.
- Add-on replacements:
  - Mosquitto → `services.mosquitto`
  - ESPHome → `services.esphome`
  - Studio Code Server → `services.code-server` (or skip; edit from this repo)
  - Node-RED → `services.node-red`
- Persistent state (`/var/lib/hass`) stays on the host, but is the **only** mutable surface — config files are all in the Nix store.

**Pros:** Fully reproducible, atomic rollback via `nixos-rebuild switch --rollback`, no qcow2, no Supervisor security surface, plugins reviewed in PRs.
**Cons:** No Add-on Store — every add-on must have a Nix equivalent or be packaged. Possible feature regressions for HACS-only integrations not yet in nixpkgs. Migration is a one-way door (statefulness: HA DB, Zigbee mesh keys).

### Option C — Containerised HA + git-tracked config-dir (hybrid, "servarr-style")

Splits the difference. HA runs as an OCI container under the existing `homelab.compose` framework (alongside the other stacks on `discovery`), and a separate repo (or subdir of this one) holds `/config`.

- New stack `home-assistant` under `/home/erik/servarr/machines/discovery/home-assistant/`:
  - `compose.yaml` runs `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable` with `network_mode: host`, `--device=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N-...`.
  - `config/` bind-mount is a git submodule pointing at the private GitHub repo.
- Add-ons replaced by sibling containers in the same compose stack (Mosquitto, ESPHome, etc.) — they were going to be containers anyway under this model.
- CI: same GHA `ha core check_config` workflow against the config submodule.
- Deploy: a one-shot systemd unit (or `homelab.compose` reload) runs `git pull && docker compose restart homeassistant` after CI green.

**Pros:** Latest HA version always, no nixpkgs lag, fits the existing servarr mental model, easy declarative add-on equivalents (other containers). Config is plain YAML so HA UI edits still work; Nix-side change is minimal.
**Cons:** Slightly less "Nix-native" than Option B. Still no Supervisor UI (but that's a feature, not a bug, for our use case).

---

## 4. Recommendation

**Phase 1 → Option A (this month).** Buys version control + rollback immediately, zero risk of breaking the running instance, unblocks "PR-driven automations" workflow today.

**Phase 2 → Option C (next quarter).** Once the config is clean YAML in Git, swapping HAOS for an OCI container is a low-effort migration: stop VM, point compose stack at the same `/config` git checkout, start container, re-pair Zigbee. Matches the servarr pattern exactly and keeps `discovery` homogeneous.

**Phase 3 (optional, only if a future need pushes us) → Option B.** Pure-Nix is appealing but the Add-on/HACS regression risk is non-trivial; only worth it if we discover Supervisor itself is causing problems.

Rationale: each phase is independently shippable, and Phase 1 is already 80% of the perceived value ("declarative config of plugins and automations, synced to GitHub").

---

## 5. Phased Implementation

### Phase 1 — Git-sync the existing HAOS instance

1. **Repo bootstrap**
   - Create private GitHub repo `ErikBPF/home-assistant-config`.
   - Inside HAOS (via Studio Code Server terminal):
     ```bash
     cd /config
     git init && git branch -m main
     git config user.name "erik" && git config user.email "erik@..."
     ```
   - Add deploy key (read/write), copy public key into GitHub repo settings.

2. **`.gitignore`** — at minimum:
   ```
   secrets.yaml
   .storage/
   .cloud/
   home-assistant_v2.db*
   *.log
   *.log.*
   deps/
   tts/
   ```

3. **Restructure `configuration.yaml`** to use folder-based `!include`s:
   ```yaml
   automation: !include_dir_merge_list automations/
   script:     !include_dir_merge_named scripts/
   sensor:     !include_dir_merge_list  sensors/
   homeassistant:
     packages: !include_dir_named packages/
   ```
   Move existing UI automations into per-domain files (`automations/lighting.yaml`, etc.).

4. **Initial commit + push** — full snapshot.

5. **GitHub Actions** — `.github/workflows/validate.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Validate HA config
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     check:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
           with:
             path: "."
             secrets: ./tests/fake_secrets.yaml
             version: stable
   ```
   (`tests/fake_secrets.yaml` shadows `secrets.yaml` so CI can resolve `!secret` lookups.)

6. **Auto-commit of UI edits**
   - Shell command in `configuration.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     shell_command:
       backup_to_git: "bash /config/scripts/backup2git.sh"
     ```
   - `scripts/backup2git.sh`:
     ```bash
     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     set -e
     cd /config
     git add -A
     git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "ui: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ) auto-snapshot"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - HA automation triggers daily at 02:00.

7. **Document plugins/HACS in repo** — vendor `custom_components/<name>/` into git directly (do **not** rely on HACS pulling them at runtime). Same for blueprints under `blueprints/automation/<author>/<name>.yaml`. From here on, "install a plugin" = open a PR.

### Phase 2 — Migrate to containerised HA (Option C)

1. Add a new stack to `modules/hosts/discovery/compose.nix`:
   ```nix
   homelab.compose.stacks = [ "shared" "ai-models" "hermes-agent" "home-assistant" ];
   ```
2. Create `~/servarr/machines/discovery/home-assistant/`:
   - `compose.yaml` with `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable`, host networking, USB device passthrough by stable `by-id` path.
   - `config/` → git submodule of `home-assistant-config`.
   - Sibling services for replaced add-ons (`eclipse-mosquitto`, `esphome/esphome`).
3. **Migrate state**: full HAOS backup → restore into the container `/config` (HA's own restore handles DB, .storage, Zigbee mesh keys).
4. **Cut-over plan**: keep VM running, bring up container on a different MAC/IP, validate, then swap DHCP reservation and shut down the VM. Keep the qcow2 around for one release cycle.
5. Retire `modules/hosts/discovery/haos.nix` and `haos-domain.xml` (or gate them behind an `enable = false` toggle for one cycle).

### Phase 3 — Optional Nix-native (only if Phase 2 frustrates us)

Skipped unless we hit concrete pain (e.g., container drift, add-on coupling). Tracked but not scheduled.

---

## 6. Open Questions

- **Plugin inventory:** which HACS components are currently installed in the live HAOS? Need to enumerate before Phase 1 step 7 — anything not vendorable from upstream needs a plan.
- **Secrets strategy:** keep `secrets.yaml` outside git, or bring it into `sops-nix` like everything else in this repo? (Leans `sops-nix` for consistency.)
- **Backup target:** in Phase 2, where does the HA DB live? Same `/home/erik/vault/` mount, or onto `kepler-nfs`?
- **UI-edit policy:** allow auto-commit (current Phase 1 plan) or forbid UI edits entirely and force PR workflow? Trade-off: ergonomics vs. cleanliness of history.

---

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Leaking secrets to public repo | Private repo + strict `.gitignore` + sops-nix for `secrets.yaml` |
| Zigbee re-pair on container migration | Restore via HAOS backup file — preserves mesh keys |
| HACS plugin breakage when vendored | Pin commits in submodules / `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub` rev |
| GHA validation false-negative | Same `version: stable` track as production; pin when going to prod |
| Auto-commit loops (HA writes → push → pull → reload → HA writes) | Only commit non-`.storage` paths; never pull on the live instance unless CI is green |

---

## 8. HAOS → Container Regression Study

Concrete inventory of what disappears when we leave the HAOS VM behind (Option C / Option B). Use this checklist to decide whether each loss is acceptable before cutting over.

### 8.1 Lost: managed by Supervisor in HAOS

| HAOS feature | What it is | Container replacement | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Add-on Store (1-click installs)** | UI catalog of vetted containers (Mosquitto, ESPHome, Z2M, Node-RED, MariaDB, AdGuard, Studio Code Server, Samba, etc.) | Sibling compose services, declared in our compose stack | Each add-on needs a one-time port of its `config.yaml` + env vars to compose. Recurring cost: zero (still container, still YAML). |
| **One-click HA Core updates** | "Update available" banner → restart | `docker compose pull && up -d` (manual) or Watchtower / Renovate PR | Lose "click and done." Gain: pinned versions, rollback via image tag. |
| **Update notifications in UI** | Banner when new HA Core / add-on / OS available | RSS feed → HA `feedparser` integration, or Renovate / Dependabot on the compose file | DIY notifier needed; trivial but real work. |
| **Supervisor "backup/snapshot"** | Single UI button → tar of `/config` + add-on data + HA Core state | HA 2025.1+ **native backup engine** is now first-class and works in Container too | Mostly recovered — backups stay UI-driven, just minus add-on bundles. |
| **Add-on auto-restart on config change** | Supervisor watches add-on configs | `docker compose restart <svc>` (manual or by automation) | Minor friction. |
| **Network / DNS / SSL UI panels** | Supervisor UI for hostname, static IP, Let's Encrypt | NixOS host (`networking.*`, `security.acme`) — already declarative in this repo | Net win — moves out of UI, into Nix. |
| **Hassio / Supervisor APIs** | Endpoints under `/hassio/*` used by some integrations | **Absent** in Container | Hard regression — see §8.2. |
| **"Repairs" assistant** | Supervisor-aware health checks | Reduced; HA Core repairs panel still works for non-Supervisor issues | Minor. |
| **HACS install button "Reboot host"** | HACS can request OS-level restart | Not available; host is NixOS | Manual `systemctl restart` or compose restart. |

### 8.2 Integrations that depend on the Supervisor API

These integrations only function under HAOS / Supervised and **break** under Container:

- `hassio` (the integration itself)
- Add-on entities exposed via `hassio_*` (e.g., add-on update sensors)
- Some integrations probe `/hassio/info` for host metadata
- `update.home_assistant_*` entities for Supervisor / OS updates

**Mitigation:** none — these are intrinsic to HAOS. Audit `configuration.yaml` for `hassio` references during Phase 1; flag any UI dashboards that surface Supervisor entities.

### 8.3 Not lost (common misconceptions)

- **USB / Zigbee / Z-Wave passthrough** — works identically in compose (`devices:` block + udev `by-id` path). Already proven by `containers.nix` patterns in this repo.
- **HACS itself** — installs into `/config/custom_components/` regardless of install method. (We're vendoring into Git anyway — see Phase 1.7.)
- **ESPHome dashboard** — runs as its own container, no functional loss.
- **Voice (Assist / Whisper / Piper)** — official containers exist; same model as add-ons.
- **Frontend, automations, scripts, blueprints, dashboards** — pure HA Core, untouched.
- **Native backup engine (encrypted, scheduled, S3/WebDAV targets)** — present in Container since HA 2025.1.

### 8.4 Acceptance criteria before cutting over from HAOS

- [ ] Enumerated add-ons currently installed in production HAOS (run `ha addons list` via SSH add-on).
- [ ] Every add-on in that list has either: (a) a planned compose service, or (b) explicit decision to drop.
- [ ] No active integration in `configuration.yaml` references `hassio.*` services.
- [ ] HA-native backup configured + tested before VM shutdown.
- [ ] Zigbee `coordinator_backup.json` exported (NWK keys / PAN ID) — required to re-pair without re-onboarding every device.
- [ ] Rollback plan: keep `haos_ova-17.1.qcow2` for one full release cycle, gated behind `enable = false;` in `discovery-haos`.

### 8.5 Tactical recommendation

Going from HAOS → Container costs **add-ons + Supervisor UI conveniences**. It does **not** cost any HA Core capability, integrations, automations, or device support that we currently use (modulo the `hassio` integration audit). For a homelab where everything else is already containerized + declarative, the trade is favorable. The single biggest concrete risk is Zigbee re-pairing — mitigated by exporting the coordinator backup before cut-over.

## 9. Sync Direction & Conflict Model

Bidirectional sync (UI edits flow back to GitHub **and** GitHub PRs flow forward to HA) is the goal but also the failure mode. Concrete model:

### 9.1 Direction A — HA → GitHub (push, "capture UI edits")

Trigger: HA-side automation, daily at 02:00 + on demand via UI button.

Flow:
1. `scripts/backup2git.sh` runs `git add -A && git commit -m "ui: <ts>" && git push origin main` (or `git push origin ui-snapshot-<ts>` for safer PR review).
2. GHA validation runs on the resulting commit / PR.
3. Pre-existing protected `.gitignore` excludes `.storage/`, DB, secrets, logs.

Risks:
- UI edits could push broken YAML — GHA catches it post-hoc, not pre.
- Commits land directly on `main` if pushing to `main` — bypasses review.

Mitigation: push to a per-day branch (`ui-snapshot-2026-05-23`) and open a PR via `gh pr create` in the script; nothing lands on `main` without GHA green + manual merge.

### 9.2 Direction B — GitHub → HA (pull, "deploy PRs")

Trigger: GHA `workflow_run` on green CI, OR GitHub webhook → HA webhook automation.

Flow:
1. PR merged to `main` → GHA `validate.yaml` passes → workflow dispatches webhook to `https://ha.local/api/webhook/<token>`.
2. HA automation receives webhook → `shell_command.git_pull` runs `cd /config && git pull --ff-only`.
3. Automation calls `homeassistant.reload_all` (or restart, depending on what changed).

Risks:
- Webhook exposed publicly. Mitigation: `local_only: true` on the trigger + tailscale/VPN-only path, or a GHA self-hosted runner inside the LAN that does the pull via SSH.
- Pull happens while UI is mid-edit → un-committed UI changes get clobbered.
- `git pull --ff-only` fails if Direction A pushed first and trees diverged.

Mitigation: Direction A always pushes to a branch, never to `main`. Direction B only pulls `main`. `main` only moves via merged PR. **No commits ever happen directly on the live `/config` clone of `main`.**

### 9.3 The conflict question

If both directions are enabled naively, the loop is:
> UI edit → auto-commit to `main` → CI passes → pull on the live instance (no-op, already there) → UI edit again → ...

Safe enough *for non-overlapping files*. Breaks when the same file is touched by both a PR and a UI edit between snapshots.

**Recommended policy (Phase 1):**

| File class | Edit allowed via | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| `configuration.yaml`, `packages/`, `custom_components/`, `blueprints/`, `*.nix` | **PR only** | Git |
| `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `scenes.yaml`, `ui-lovelace.yaml` (UI-managed) | UI **or** PR, never both for the same entity | Either, last-write-wins per snapshot window |
| `.storage/`, DB, secrets | UI only (never in Git) | HAOS |

`restart_ignore` (à la official `git_pull` add-on) covers the UI-managed bucket — `git pull` doesn't restart HA when only those files changed, avoiding noisy reloads.

### 9.4 Phased sync rollout

| Phase | Direction A (HA → GH) | Direction B (GH → HA) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1a** | ✅ daily auto-commit to `ui-snapshot-*` branch → PR | ❌ off | One-way snapshot; humans cherry-pick into `main`. Lowest risk. |
| **1b** | ✅ same | ✅ webhook → `git pull main` + reload, `local_only` | Bidirectional with policy above. |
| **2 (container)** | ✅ same | ✅ either webhook or `homeassistant/git_pull`-equivalent sidecar in compose | Same model, container-native. |

Start at 1a; promote to 1b only after a week with no surprises.

### 9.5 Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `.gitignore` audited — no `secrets.yaml` or `.storage/` ever pushed.
- [ ] Direction A pushes to non-`main` branch → PR.
- [ ] Direction B uses `--ff-only`; logs failures to a `persistent_notification`.
- [ ] Webhook endpoint not exposed to the public internet (Tailscale-only or LAN-only).
- [ ] `restart_ignore` covers UI-managed files so cosmetic pulls don't bounce HA.
- [ ] Disaster test: delete `/config`, re-clone from `main`, restore secrets from sops, restore `.storage/` from latest HA backup → instance returns to working state.
